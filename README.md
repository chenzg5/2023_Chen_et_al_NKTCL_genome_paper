# NKTCL-genome-paper-figures
This repository contains scripts to recreate the figures from our submitting paper about the genomic analysis of NKTCL.
Most figures in the article can be generated by following the steps of the softwares mentioned in the article (e.g., MAFtools, SigProfile, CNVkit, ShatterSeek, et al). In this repository, we mainly provides the individual scripts for visualizing analysis results, including the molecular subtyping system, survival analysis, distribution of mutations in different cohort and sankey-diagram.
